# Codesearch

Semantic code search powered by ML embeddings and Tree-sitter AST analysis. Finds code by meaning, not just text matching.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill **immediately** when:
- User asks to find code by **intent** (e.g., "where is authentication handled?")
- User asks to understand **what code does** (e.g., "how does the indexer work?")
- User asks to explore **functionality** (e.g., "find error handling logic")
- User asks about **implementation details** (e.g., "how are embeddings generated?")
- You need to discover code related to a **concept** rather than an exact string

## When to Use Built-in Tools Instead

Use Grep/Glob for:
- Exact text matching: `Grep "fn new_indexer"` (find exact function name)
- Specific imports: `Grep "use tokio"` (find import statements)
- File patterns: `Glob "**/*.rs"` (find files by extension)
- Variable references: `Grep "config_path"` (find exact variable name)

## Installation

If the `codesearch` binary is not found, install it automatically by running the install script bundled with this skill:

```shell
INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" sh .claude/skills/codesearch/install.sh
```

After installation, verify it works:

```shell
codesearch --version
```

> **Note:** The script downloads the latest release binary from GitHub for the current OS/architecture. It installs to `$INSTALL_DIR` (defaults to `$HOME/.local/bin` above). Ensure `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `PATH`.

## Prerequisites

Before using codesearch, the target repository must be indexed:

```shell
# Index a repository (run once, supports incremental updates)
codesearch index /path/to/repo

# Index with a custom name
codesearch index /path/to/repo --name my-project

# Force full re-index (ignores cached file hashes)
codesearch index /path/to/repo --force
```

## Semantic Search

Use `codesearch search` to find code by describing what it does in natural language:

```shell
# Search with natural language
codesearch search "user authentication flow"
codesearch search "error handling middleware"
codesearch search "database connection setup"
codesearch search "API request validation"

# Limit number of results (default: 10)
codesearch search "error handling" --num 5

# Filter by minimum relevance score (0.0-1.0)
codesearch search "authentication" --min-score 0.5

# Filter by programming language
codesearch search "struct definition" --language rust
codesearch search "class hierarchy" --language python --language typescript

# Filter by repository (when multiple repos are indexed)
codesearch search "config loading" --repository my-project
```

### Supported Languages

Codesearch supports: **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, **HCL**, **PHP**, **C++**

### What Gets Indexed

Codesearch uses Tree-sitter to extract and index these code constructs:
- Functions and methods
- Structs, classes, and enums
- Traits and implementations
- Modules, constants, and typedefs
- Import statements

## Repository Management

```shell
# List all indexed repositories
codesearch list

# View indexing statistics
codesearch stats

# Delete a repository from the index
codesearch delete <id-or-path>
```

## Query Best Practices

**Do:**
```shell
codesearch search "How are file chunks created and stored?"
codesearch search "Vector embedding generation process"
codesearch search "Configuration loading and validation"
codesearch search "HTTP request routing logic"
```

**Don't:**
```shell
codesearch search "func"          # Too vague
codesearch search "error"         # Too generic
codesearch search "HandleRequest" # Use Grep for exact name matches
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with `codesearch search`** to find relevant code semantically
2. **Use `Read` tool** to examine the files and lines from search results
3. **Use `Grep`** only for exact string searches when you know the identifier name
4. **Use `codesearch search`** again with refined queries if initial results aren't specific enough

## Advanced Configuration

```shell
# Use a custom data directory for the index
codesearch --data-dir /custom/path search "query"

# Use a namespace to isolate projects
codesearch --namespace my-project search "query"

# Use in-memory storage (no persistence, useful for one-off searches)
codesearch --memory-storage search "query"

# Disable result reranking (faster but less accurate)
codesearch --no-rerank search "query"
```
